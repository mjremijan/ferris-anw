# ANW Website Parser

This project is used in combination with the UNAA and FINA websites.
UNAA and FINA post competition schedules on their websites. When then do, we 
need to go through them and determine which ones we will attend. Because the
websites are updated with new competitions throughout the season, trying to
keep track of which ones we've seen and haven't is a big job.

My solution is to keep a Microsoft Access database of all the ANW data so that
it is easier to manager. See 'Database' below for details. The Access database
has queries for each month of the season, showing all the competitons for all
the leagues that are within a reasonable driving distance.

The code in this project helps parse the website data. See 'UNAA' and 'FINA'
below for details on getting the data from the website into the Access database.
